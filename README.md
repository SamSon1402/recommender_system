## Introduction

This Python Project processes movie data, including genres, keywords, cast, and crew information. It then computes similarity between movies based on their attributes and provides a function to recommend similar movies given a movie title. Finally, it saves the similarity matrix and preprocessed data for later use.

## Installation

Load the dataset using this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
 , download the dataset credits and movies
run this command from the terminal 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Then use this command to run the streamlit application 




streamlit run app.py



##  Type the name of the movie you want to ask for a recommendation and click on the recommend button to get the recommendation. You will receive the top 5 similar movies.
